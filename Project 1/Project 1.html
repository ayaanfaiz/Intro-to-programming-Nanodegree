            <h2>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
            <p>
               HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML
               documents form the majority of the content on the web.
               HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes
               "what you see" and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it
               looks". 
            </p>
            <div >The web is composed largely of HTML documents.
               The components of the web include the client (your computer and browser), the Internet, and servers.
               The client and servers interact through something called the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

               <p>
                  HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When
                  writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element
                  by using HTML tags.

               </p>
               <p>
                  Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
                  literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small
                  mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.

               </p>
               <p>
                  HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.
                  Block elements form an "invisible box" around the
                  content inside of them.
